## Introduction to Innovation and Business
The first surprising concept I learned from this course is **Effectuation**."Effectuation is a way of thinking and decision-making that is based on the idea that entrepreneurs create their future by taking action and making things happen. It is a way of thinking that is **focused on creating opportunities and solving problems by using the resources that are available to you, rather than making predictions and trying to plan for the future**." This idea gave me a new perspective on entrepreneurship. I think it provides a plausible explanation for entrepreneurial success, standing out from the superficial and accidental success theories I’ve encountered before. Furthermore, I’m considering how this theory might apply to my personal goals. At the moment, I want to apply for a PhD position, but one of the major challenges is that I’m uncertain about which research area to pursue. Perhaps this uncertainty stems from my attempt to *"predict the future"*. Therefore, one way forward could be to apply the principles of **Effectuation** to the process of applying for PhD positions.


- An effectual leader will strive to (co-)create, shape and transform their environment, and not strive to predict the future. (Read et al.)
